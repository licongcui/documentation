### Physio-MIMI Overview

> Physio-MIMI (Multi-Modality, Multi-Resource Information Integration environment) is an NCRR-funded, multi-CTSA site project designed to develop novel, flexible informatics methodologies, tools and infrastructure to facilitate the collection, management, and analysis of clinical and physiological data.

> Physio-MIMI supports collaborative clinical and translational research using diverse data types across institutions. It builds upon, integrates, and extends two existing informatics initiatives: MIMI (CWRU) and Honest Broker (University of Michigan). MIMI is a web-based data and research management system that consists of three conceptually independent but interconnected servers: Meta-Server, Application Server and Data Resource Server.

### Physio-MIMI VISAGE Interface
VISAGE (VISual AGgregator and Explorer) is the query interface developed for Physio-MIMI. The goal is for VISAGE to be directly used by clinical researchers, for activities such as data exploration seeking to formulate, clarify, and determine the availability of support for potential hypotheses as well as for cohort identification for clinical trials.

VISAGE has three main components: 
1. Query Builder, with ontology-driven terminology support and visual controls such as slider bar and radio button; 
2. Query Manager, which stores and labels queries for reuse and sharing; and 
3. Query Explorer, for comparative analysis of one or multiple sets of query results for purposes such as screening, case-control comparison and longitudinal studies.
